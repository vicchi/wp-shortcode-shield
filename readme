Allows posts and pages to easily document WordPress shortcodes without the shortcode being expanded.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to refer to a WordPress shortcode within the content of posts and pages without that shortcode being automagically expanded by WordPress. The plugin takes advantage of the fact that the [WordPress ShortCode API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API) does not support nested shortcodes to allow this plugin's shortcode to wrap the shortcode being documented.

> The shortcode parser uses a single pass on the post content. This means that if 
> the $content parameter of a shortcode handler contains another shortcode, it won't
> be parsed

The plugin supports both the self closing `[shortcode]` and enclosing `[shortcode]content[/shortcode]` forms and supports a short form name of the shortcode, `[wp_scs]` as well as the more verbose `[wp_shortcode_shield]` form. For the sake of brevity, the remainder of this documentation will use the `[wp_scs]` short form name.

If using the self-closing form of the shortcode, you need to supply the name of the shortcode you are documenting using the `code` attribute but without using the enclosing `[` and `]` characters. This is because when parsing shortcodes, WordPress looks for the first occurrence of the ']' character to terminate the shortcode. As a result of this, usage such as

`[wp_scs code="[another-shortcode-name]"]`

... WordPress will use the ']' character inside the `code` attribute to try and terminate the shortcode name, which is not what is desired. Instead, the plugin automagically adds the terminating '[' and ']' characters to the plugin's output, so that usage such as

`[wp_scs code="another-shortcode-name"]`

... will display *[another-shortcode-name]* in your post's of page's content.

If you are using the enclosing form of the shortcode, you can either supply the shortcode to be documented with or without enclosing '[' and ']' characters; if they are omitted, the plugin will add them for you, so that usage such as

`[wp_scs][another-shortcode-name][/wp_scs]`

... and

`[wp_scs]another-shortcode-name[/wp_scs]`

... will display the same results, namely *[another-shortcode-name]*.

Finally a note of caution, you cannot mix the enclosing and self closing form of the plugin's shortcode within the same post or page; this is not a limitation of the plugin, but the way in which WordPress implements the [ShortCode API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API) ...

> The parser does not handle mixing of enclosing and non-enclosing forms of the same
> shortcode as you would want it to. For example, if you have:
>
> `[myshortcode example='non-enclosing' /] non-enclosed content [myshortcode] enclosed content
> [/myshortcode]`
>
> Instead of being treated as two shortcodes separated by the text " non-enclosed content ",
> the parser treats this as a single shortcode enclosing " non-enclosed content [myshortcode]
> enclosed content".
